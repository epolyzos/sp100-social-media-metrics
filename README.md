# S&P 100 Social Media Sentiment and Emotion Data

This repository contains daily and monthly measures of social media sentiment, emotions and engagement for firms included in the S&P 100 index. The data are constructed from user-generated content on X (Twitter) and include multiple sentiment dictionaries, emotion indicators and tweet-based activity measures.

The dataset is designed to support research on brand value, firm valuation and the economic impact of online sentiment and emotions. It accompanies an academic research project that examines how social media sentiment and emotional content affect firm value across heterogeneous firm characteristics.

## Variables and Measurement

The dataset contains **daily and monthly firm-level indicators** derived from user-generated content on X (Twitter).  
All measures are aggregated at the firm–date level and, where applicable, weighted by post impressions.

  Reference: Loughran and McDonald (2011), *Journal of Finance*.

- **Bing Sentiment**

- Sentiment and emotion scores are computed at the post level and aggregated using **unweighted** and **impression-weighted averages**.
