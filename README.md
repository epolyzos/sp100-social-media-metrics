# S&P 100 Social Media Sentiment and Emotion Data

This repository contains monthly and quarterly measures of social media sentiment, emotions, and engagement for firms included in the S&P 100 index. The data are constructed from user-generated content on X (Twitter) and include multiple sentiment dictionaries, emotion indicators, and tweet-based activity measures.

The dataset is designed to support research on brand value, firm valuation and the economic impact of online sentiment and emotions. It accompanies an academic research project that examines how social media sentiment and emotional content affect firm value across heterogeneous firm characteristics.

- Firm-level monthly and quarterly sentiment indices  
- Emotion measures (e.g. joy, anger, fear, uncertainty)  
- Tweet counts, impressions, and engagement-based indicators
